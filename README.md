# Open WP Backup

This plugin is currently under development and is not yet ready for use in production.

Open WP Backup is an open source Wordpress plugin that lets you easily perform and schedule backups of your website.

## How does it work?

This plugin is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. It allows you to create two types of backups for your Wordpress site:

-   **Instant Backups**, which are triggered at the touch of a button.\*\* \*\*
-   **Scheduled Backups**, which let you save your site on a regular basis without having to worry about a thing.

In the future, a pro version of this plugin will enable you to **automatically upload your backups to a cloud space** such as Onedrive, Google Drive, AWS and others.
